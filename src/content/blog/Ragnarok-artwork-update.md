At Ragnarok NFT Game, we are excited to announce that we have created 200 new pieces of artwork inspired by Norse mythology, from stunning portraits of gods to fearsome creatures from the Ragnarok universe.

### Current challenges related to the art of the game:

- Reducing the time to create each new piece with AI, so we have been experimenting with different inputs with the AI bot to get the maximum detail in the shortest time possible. On average, a new piece is generated in 25 min.

- We strive to ensure that each artwork piece has an artistic feel. Setting a benchmark to achieve this goal has been a challenge, but we are dedicated to working to make each piece memorable.

### Next steps related to the art of the game

- Reach 450 pieces produced
- Debug the 450 pieces that originated with AI to have a database of 300 unique pieces on average that meet the art standards for the NFT art

Afterward, we will work on editing each piece in programs such as Photoshop to ensure that all the details are in place and that the quality of the artwork is enhanced.

### We show some recently created artwork (Not debugged):

## Intro to Hive

Hive is a decentralized blockchain with fast transaction speed (3s) without fees, human readable account names, decentralized community fund and algorithmic stablecoin (HBD) backed by HIVE.

Blockchain powered by Delegated Proof of Stakes (DPOS) consensus which perfectly balances scaling, decentralization and speed.

Hive blockchain pioneers innovations such as Resource Credits system, Human readable usernames, algorithmic stablecoin in blockchain space.

Resource Credits - system allows users to stake HIVE token and get allocated resources to perform basically free transactions on chain, without paying huge fees like other blockchains Bitcoin or Ethereum.

Human readable usernames - makes it easy to remember account names of businesses or people you interact with, making social and transactional interactions easy.

Algorithmic stablecoin - backed by HIVE token has been running almost a decade long without any issues, making it one of the very first algorithmic stable coins.

Social networking - initial and most successful applications built on Hive are decentralized, community owned social networking applications. Making it very first blockchain to truly empower free speech and decentralized information distribution network on web3.

Decentralized Hive Fund - community owned and controlled funds helping blockchain to allocate funds to many developers and teams across the world to build and innovate.

Gaming, NFT, DEFI and more - easy development and easy integration with above benefits giving developers/creators enough reason to build applications on Web3, thatâ€™s engaging and growing.

## Web2 vs Web3

Internet, we know of today mostly contain websites and services which is referred as Web2. Dominated by companies that provide services in exchange for your personal data. Blockchains such as Hive, powers websites and services that go into Web3 category, referring to decentralized apps which runs on the blockchain. These are apps that allow anyone to participate without monetising their personal data, true ownership.

| Aspect         | Web2                                                            | Web3                                                         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Data Ownership | Controlled by centralized entities                              | Decentralized, users own their data                          |
| Trust          | Relies on trust in centralized entities                         | Trustless system through blockchain technology               |
| Censorship     | Vulnerable to censorship by centralized authorities             | Resistant to censorship due to decentralization              |
| Scalability    | Limited scalability due to centralized infrastructure           | Potential for greater scalability through decentralization   |
| Transparency   | Lack of transparency in data handling                           | Transparent, immutable record on the blockchain              |
| Governance     | Controlled by centralized entities                              | Community-driven governance through DAOs                     |
| Monetization   | Centralized monetization models (e.g., advertising)             | Decentralized monetization via tokens and smart contracts    |
| Intermediaries | Relies heavily on intermediaries (e.g., social media platforms) | Removes intermediaries through decentralization              |
| Innovation     | Innovation driven by large tech companies                       | Innovation driven by decentralized protocols and communities |

## Developer workflow

This is high level representation of how websites or services talk with blockchain. Itâ€™s important to note that this is an oversimplification of the Hive network for the purposes of making it easier to understand learning.
